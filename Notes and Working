Notes
VPN Logs: Currently simulated; extend collect_logs() to read from VPN log files (e.g., OpenVPN logs).
Customization: Add more rules or integrate Sysmon for advanced event collection.
Security: This is a basic tool—use in production with caution. For real SIEM, consider hardening and testing.
Extensions: Add more visualizations or export features.

How It Works
The script runs continuously, collecting logs every 60 seconds.
Parses logs for detection rules.
Stores logs in SQLite and triggers alerts if rules match.
Flask dashboard runs on http://localhost:5000 for viewing.
